Problem
=================

You must Implement an intelligent algorithm in Python which shows, on a weekly basis, a list of coffee chats for every Aspiring Professional on the Platform. The curated list must take into account, among other factors, facts like the industry of the Aspiring Professional, industry of Senior Executives on the Platform, interests of the Aspiring Professional (as determined by activity on the Platform), frequency at which each Senior Executive has already been appearing on the roster, etc. A full solution will include the code, automated test cases and documentation of how the algorithm works. The algorithm should run as a separate, stand-alone process.

Solution
=================

## Algorithm Signature:
MAX_algorithm(senior_executives_list,aspiring_professionals_list):  
senior_executives_list: All the Senior Executives on the platform.    
aspiring_professionals_list: All the Aspiring Professionals on the platform.     


## Algorithm Output:
2 Tables are ouputted to display data from the Algorithm
Table 1 displays the coffee chats for every Aspiring Professional on the Platform for the current week.
Table 2 outputs a Senior Executives statistcs for the week. It outlines how many times a Senior Executive appeared on the roster as well as how many coffee chats they've been scheduled for, for the week.

## Algorithm Details:
```diff
- Before proceeding, take a look at the Solutions_Architecture.pdf in the root folder
```

Assumptions/Implications:
- Frequency a Senior Executive (SE) appears on the roster indicates each time they are matched with an Aspiring Professional (AP). This means, even if an SE did not get a coffee chat with an AP for the week, their freqeuency increments. This could be helpful in determining the distribution of your AP's and can help in figuring out what other SE's should be scouted. 
EX: SE1 frequency is 3 (Matched with AP1, AP2 and AP3) but this week only got a coffee chat with AP1. This is possible if SE1 has max number of coffee chat of 1. Knowing SE1's frequency is 3, it might better the matching platform to get more SE's that have similar qualifications so that AP2 and AP3 could get a coffee chat as well.
- Trade-Off: Location for coffee chats are hardcoded to 'Online' and Date is random currently. These fields in the future could be populated by AP's and SE's themselves after scheduling a time and location that works for both of them.
- The MAX_algorithm is meant to run at the start of each week
- An AP's Interets include things they are interested in gaining from an SE's 
- An SE's Interets include what they are interested in helping AP's with

Algorithm:      
The algorithm goes through the following 3 steps in order to intellgiently output a list of coffee chats for every Aspiring Professional on the Platform
Step 1: Industry Match
Match Senior Executives (SE) with Aspiring Profssionals (AP) based on common Industry. This is because, from my experience with MAX, one of the goals is to connect aspiring individuals with senior executives
EX: Every SE in Engineering will get matched to every AP in Engineering
Step 2: Interests Match
Once all AP's have a list of all their SE industry matches, sort their SE matches from most common interets to least common interests. Research shows that mentor-mentee pair are most effective when the two are partnered up according to their interests. This was especiallly highlighted in the article published by the National Library of Medicine entitles Characteristics of Successful and Failed Mentoring Relationships: A Qualitative Study Across Two Academic Health Centers [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3665769/]
EX: After Step 1: SE1 and SE2 are matched to AP1 because of their common insudstry
    SE1: Interets are Career Development and Writing Skills
    SE2: Interets are Career Development and Communication Skills
    AP1: Interets are Career Development and Communication Skills
    AP1's matches will be ordererd as the following: SE2, SE1. This is becaues AP1 has more common interets with SE2 than SE1
Step 3: Set up Coffee Chats
This step requires you to iterate through the AP's sorted matches and set up coffee chats. However, there are a number of cases to consider. It was assumed that due to the nature of SE's roles, All SE's have a max number of coffee chats they can commit to. Every match goes through the following:
1) If the AP had a coffee chat the week before with this SE, DO NOT set up another coffee chat. This is to ensure that SE's are circulating between all AP's
2) If the SE is near their max number of coffee chats and the current AP already has atleast one coffee chat DO NOT set up a coffee chat. This is so that you can distrubute SE to other AP
3) Otherwise, If the SE can commit to another coffee chat, DO set up a coffee chat

Future Goals:  
- Allow AP's to rank SE's after Coffee Chats. Instead of just sorting by the number of common Interets, SE's can be moved up or down in the list depending on an AP's rank
- Add a 'Hobbies' section to SE and AP to better the matching algorithm
- Increase speed of algorithm by optimzing parts of the algorithm that have a time complexity of O(N^2) 

Running The Code
=================

## Running Without Changing:
Below are the steps to run the algorithm using the mock data provide in the data/ directory
1) In the "/src" folder run setup.py
$  python .\setup.py
The setup installs the following packages:
pip install tabulate
pip install pytest
2) In the "/data" folder you can view the mock AP's and SE's on the platform in aspiring_professional_data.json and senior_executive_data.json respectively
3) In the src folder run main.py
$ python .\main.py

If you didn't make any changes you should see the tables as seen in Algorithm Output[#algorithm-output]

## Running With Changing:
Below are the steps to run the algorithm using your own data. 

1) In main.py (Malik_Aleema\src\main.py) create as many as Senior Executives and add them  to a list : (Malik_Aleema\src\senior_executive.py). 
senior_executive_list = []      
new_senior_executive = SeniorExecutive(2, 'Faheema', 'Abid', 'Finance', 1, ['interest1', 'interest2'])    
senior_executive_list.append(new_senior_executive)   
2) Create as many as Aspiring Professionals and add them  to a list : (Malik_Aleema\src\aspiring_professional.py).  
aspiring_professionals_list = []  
new_aspiring_professionals = AspiringProfessional(1, 'Aleema', 'Malik', 'Consulting', ['interest1', 'interest2', 'interest3'])  
aspiring_professionals_list.append(new_aspiring_professionals).   
3) Run the algorithm. It will return a coffee chat object : (Malik_Aleema\src\coffee_chat.py). 
coffee_chats = MAX_algorithm(senior_executive_list,aspiring_professionals_list). 
4) To see the contents of the coffee_chat printed in a table format to command line you can use the following method. 
print_coffee_chats(coffee_chats,senior_executives_list, aspiring_professionals_list)
